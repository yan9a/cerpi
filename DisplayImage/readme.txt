Generate the executable

After making CMakeLists.txt, just proceed as with any other project using CMake:

-------------------------------------
cd <program_directory>
cmake .
make
-------------------------------------


Result

By now you should have an executable. You just have to run it, i.e.:

-------------------------------------
gksudo ./DisplayImage
-------------------------------------
